#About
PocketDistrict is your one-stop shop to finding parties, bars, events and jobs in your neighborhood, in <b>real time</b>. By using an algorithm to sort data from Twitter, Facebook, Yelp, and Instagram, it produces results and ratings (for Restaurants and venues) of any topic you search for. Looking for a good happy hour special? Trying to find concerts or secret shows? Looking for sales at local shops? Want to know what people's opinions are on a matter in your area? PocketDistrict can provide all the answers, and then some. 

On top of that, you can get a world perspective in topics of your choice. For example, want to know what people are thinking in Paris about the US Elections? Type in Eiffel Tower for location, add a 30 mile radius and use keywords like "Trump" or "Presidential elections".
